# SPIRE Tutorials - OpenShift

Built on the [SPIRE Tutorials](https://github.com/spiffe/spire-tutorials/) repository with considerations for integrating SPIRE with OpenShift. This repository is not intended to replace the existing SPIRE Tutorials repository, but supplement with the necessary changes for deployment in OpenShift.
